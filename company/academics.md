# Academics

## Free Academic Team

Collaborate easily, whether your colleagues are sitting in the same lab or thousands of miles away. W&B gives you a shared set of dashboards and a space to write notes on interactive graphs. This system of records makes it possible to look across all the experiments you've run in a project, not just the last few that you remembered to write down.
