# Private Hosting

### Quickstart W\&B private-hosting

1. Run `wandb local`
2. Generate a free license from the [Deployer](https://deploy.wandb.ai).
3. Add it to your local settings

#### Paste your license in the ** `/system-admin`** page on your local server

We also offer [W\&B Enterprise Cloud](cloud.md), which runs a completely scalable infrastructure within your company's AWS or GCP account. This system is a good choice for massively scalable experiment tracking.
