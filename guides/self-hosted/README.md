# Private Hosting

## Quickstart to W\&B private-hosting

1.  On any machine with [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [Python](https://www.python.org) installed, run:

    ```
    pip install wandb
    wandb local 
    ```
2. Generate a free license from the [Deployer](https://deploy.wandb.ai).
3. Add it to your local settings.

#### Paste the license in the ** `/system-admin`** page on your local host

![Copy your license from Deployer and paste it into your Local settings](<../../.gitbook/assets/2022-02-24 22.13.59 (6).gif>)

We also offer [W\&B Enterprise Cloud](cloud.md), which runs a completely scalable infrastructure within your company's AWS or GCP account. This system is a good choice for massively scalable experiment tracking.
