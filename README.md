# Weights & Biases

Weights & Biases helps you keep track of your machine learning projects. Use our tools to log hyperparameters and output metrics from your runs, then visualize and compare results and quickly share findings with your colleagues. 

Here is a quick overview of our lightweight, modular tools:

1. [**Dashboard**](app/): Experiment tracking
2. [**Artifacts**](artifacts/): Dataset versioning, model versioning
3. [**Sweeps**](sweeps/): Hyperparameter optimization
4. [**Reports**](reports.md): Save and share reproducible findings

## Getting Started

Easily add our Python library `wandb` to your machine learning script.

* [Quickstart](quickstart.md)
* [Keras integration](integrations/keras.md)
* [PyTorch integration](integrations/pytorch.md)
* [TensorFlow integration](integrations/tensorflow.md)
* [Jupyter notebook integration](integrations/jupyter.md)

Here's a sample screenshot from a [Species Identification project](https://app.wandb.ai/stacey/curr_learn/reports?view=stacey%2FSpecies%20Identification) in W&B.
