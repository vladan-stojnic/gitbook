# wandb.restore\(\)

## Overview

Calling `wandb.restore(filename)`will restore a file into your local run directory. Typically`filename` refers to a file generated by an earlier experiment run and uploaded to our cloud. This call will make a local copy of the file and return a local file stream open for reading.

`wandb.restore` accepts a few optional keyword arguments:

* **run\_path** — string referring to the earlier run from which to pull the file, formatted as _'$ENTITY\_NAME/$PROJECT\_NAME/$RUN\_ID'_  or _'$PROJECT\_NAME/$RUN\_ID'_ \(default: current entity, project name, and run id\)
* **replace** — boolean specifying whether to overwrite a local copy of filename with the cloud copy, if a local copy turns out to be available \(default: False\)
* **root** — string specifying the directory in which to store the local copy of the file. This defaults to the current working directory, or the`wandb.run.dir`if wandb.init was called earlier \(default: "."\)

Common use cases:

* restore the model architecture or weights generated by past runs
* resume training from the last checkpoint in the case of failure \(see the section on [resuming](resuming.md) for crucial details\)

## Examples

See [this report](https://app.wandb.ai/lavanyashukla/save_and_restore/reports/Saving-and-Restoring-Models-with-W%26B--Vmlldzo3MDQ3Mw) for a complete working example.

```python
# restore a model file from a specific run by user "vanpelt" in "my-project"
best_model = wandb.restore('model-best.h5', run_path="vanpelt/my-project/a1b2c3d")

# restore a weights file from a checkpoint
# (NOTE: resuming must be configured if run_path is not provided)
weights_file = wandb.restore('weights.h5')
# use the "name" attribute of the returned object
# if your framework expects a filename, e.g. as in Keras
my_predefined_model.load_weights(weights_file.name)
```

> If you don't specify a run\_path, you'll need to configure [resuming](resuming.md) for your run. If you want access to files programmatically outside of training, use the [Run API](restore.md).
