# Command Line Interface

After running `pip install wandb` you should have a new command available, **wandb**.

The following sub-commands are available:

| Sub-command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| docs | Open documentation in a browser |
| init | Configure a directory with W&B |
| login | Login to W&B |
| offline | Only save run data locally, no cloud syncing \(`off` deprecated\) |
| online | Ensure W&B is enabled in this directory \(`on` deprecated\) |
| disabled | Disables all API calls, useful for testing |
| enabled | Same as `online`, resumes normal W&B logging, once you've finished testing |
| docker | Run a docker image, mount cwd, and ensure wandb is installed |
| docker-run | Add W&B environment variables to a docker run command |
| projects | List projects |
| pull | Pull files for a run from W&B |
| restore | Restore code and config state for a run |
| run | Launch a non-python program, for python use wandb.init\(\) |
| runs | List runs in a project |
| sync | Sync a local directory containing tfevents or previous runs files |
| status | List current directory status |
| sweep | Create a new sweep given a YAML definition |
| agent | Start an agent to run programs in the sweep |

## Restore the state of your code

Use `restore` to return to the state of your code when you ran a given run.

### Example

```python
# creates a branch and restores the code to the state it was in when run $RUN_ID was executed
wandb restore $RUN_ID
```

**How do we capture the state of the code?**

When `wandb.init` is called from your script, a link is saved to the last git commit if the code is in a git repository. A diff patch is also created in case there are uncommitted changes or changes that are out of sync with your remote.
